## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom royal theme variables
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactions

### Backend Architecture

- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **API**: RESTful API with JSON responses

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Client, server, and shared code in one repository for easier development
2. **TypeScript Throughout**: Full type safety across frontend, backend, and shared schemas
3. **Component-Based UI**: Reusable components following shadcn/ui patterns
4. **Premium Royal Theme**: Enhanced luxury branding with sophisticated animations, premium gradients, and multi-layered visual effects
5. **Advanced Animation System**: Framer Motion with custom keyframes for premium user experience

## Key Components

### Database Schema (shared/schema.ts)

- **MongoDB Integration**: Connected to MongoDB Atlas with production database
- **Menu Items**: Products with name, description, price, category, veg/non-veg status, images, restaurantId, and availability
- **Cart Items**: User's selected items with quantities and timestamps
- **Users**: Basic user authentication schema with timestamps
- **ObjectId Support**: All database operations use MongoDB ObjectId for proper document identification

### Frontend Components

- **Welcome Page**: Landing page with restaurant information and royal branding
- **Menu Page**: Interactive menu browser with category filtering and search
- **Dish Cards**: Individual menu item displays with add-to-cart functionality
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library for consistent styling

### Backend Routes

- **Menu Management**: GET endpoints for retrieving menu items by category or ID
- **Cart Management**: CRUD operations for shopping cart functionality
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware

## Data Flow

1. **Menu Display**: Frontend fetches menu items from `/api/menu-items` endpoint
2. **Category Filtering**: Client-side filtering by category and dietary preferences
3. **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across item names and descriptions
4. **Cart Operations**: Add/remove items via `/api/cart` endpoints
5. **State Management**: TanStack Query handles caching and synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies

- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Linting**: TypeScript compiler checks
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer and error overlay plugins

## Deployment Strategy

### Development

- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` runs both frontend (Vite) and backend (tsx)
- **Database**: Uses MongoDB database via MONGODB_URI environment variable
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx watch mode for backend

### Production - Replit

- **Build Process**:
  1. `vite build` compiles frontend to `dist/public`
  2. `esbuild` bundles backend to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Single Node.js process serving both static files and API
- **Database**: Production MongoDB database required

### Production - Vercel (New)

- **Frontend**: Static files built to `dist/public` and served via CDN
- **Backend**: Serverless functions in `api/` directory using Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with external connections enabled
- **Configuration**: `vercel.json` handles routing and build configuration

### Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: MONGODB_URI for database connection
- **Static Files**: Frontend served as static assets
- **API Routes**: Backend handles `/api/*` routes, frontend handles client-side routing
- **Vercel Setup**: Serverless architecture with separate frontend/backend deployment
